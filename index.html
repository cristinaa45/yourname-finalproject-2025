          Fashion in Ecuador is more than just clothing—it's a powerful expression of cultural identity. The country's diverse Indigenous communities each have their own styles, shaped by centuries of tradition and environmental influences. Clothing is often handmade using natural fibers and dyes derived from local plants. One standout material is tagua, known as “vegetable ivory,” which symbolizes Ecuador’s creativity and commitment to sustainability. <br><br>
          During the Spanish colonial period, European fashion was introduced and slowly fused with Indigenous styles, giving rise to a rich mestizo tradition. The resulting garments are not only beautiful but tell a story of resistance, resilience, and identity. Today, Ecuadorian fashion continues to evolve, balancing heritage and innovation.
