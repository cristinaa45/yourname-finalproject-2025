        <p>
          Fashion is a reflection of who we are, our culture, and identity. Ecuador is home to diverse indigenous groups, each with unique costumes and traditions. They use local materials and natural dyes to create textiles that reflect their environment and culture. Tagua, or "vegetable ivory," is a notable material. The Spanish colonial period introduced European styles, leading to a fusion of traditions in the mestizo population.
